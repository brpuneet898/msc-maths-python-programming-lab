## 1. Setting Up Your System

1. **Download & Install Python**
   - Go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Download the latest stable version.
   - **Important:** While installing, check the box that says:
     ```
     Add Python to PATH
     ```

2. **Install Required Packages**
   - Open your terminal (Command Prompt / PowerShell / Terminal).
   - Run the following commands:
     ```bash
     pip install jupyterlab ipykernel
     pip install vscode
     ```

Or you can choose to download the VS Code directly from the browser itself.

## 2. Assignment Details

- Assignments will be released **weekly**.
- Each assignment will be a Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`).
- The naming convention will be:

```text
week<number>\_assignment.ipynb
```

Example:

```text
week1\_assignment.ipynb
week2\_assignment.ipynb
```

**Strict Rule:** Do **not** change the file name.

---

## 3. Completing Assignments

- Try to complete each assignment within **1 hour**.
- Solve it using **your preferred IDE** (JupyterLab, VS Code, etc.).
- Do **not** alter:
- The file name
- The file structure

Since grading will be **automated**, any changes outside of allowed edits will result in **zero marks**.

---

## 4. Submitting Assignments

1. You will be provided with a **Google Drive link** to a folder named:

```text
submitted
```

2. Inside the `submitted` folder:
- Create a folder with **your full name** (use lowercase for consistency). **Do not put any space between your name, if there are 2 words, use _ (underscore) between them.**
- Example:

  ```
  /submitted/puneet
  ```

3. Inside your personal folder, create subfolders for each week:

```text
/submitted/\<your\_name>/week1
/submitted/\<your\_name>/week2
...
/submitted/\<your\_name>/week10
```

4. When submitting:
- Do **not** rename the assignment file.
- Place it inside the correct weekâ€™s folder.

Example (if your name is Puneet):

```text
/submitted/puneet/week1/week1\_assignment.ipynb
/submitted/puneet/week2/week2\_assignment.ipynb
```

## 5. After Submission

- Once the **deadline** is passed, the instructor will **autograde** the submissions.
- Feedback will be shared after grading.
- If your submission does not follow the **exact structure**, you may lose marks.

## Key Reminders
